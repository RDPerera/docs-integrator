# Overview

Oracle Database is a multi-model relational database management system widely used for enterprise workloads. The Ballerina `ballerinax/oracledb` connector (v1.17.0) provides programmatic access to Oracle Database through JDBC, enabling you to execute queries, perform CRUD operations, call stored procedures, and work with Oracle-specific data types such as VARRAYs, nested tables, OBJECT types, and interval types within your Ballerina integration flows. It also supports real-time Change Data Capture (CDC) through a LogMiner-based listener.


## Key features

- Execute parameterized SQL queries with streaming result sets via `query` and single-row retrieval via `queryRow`
- Perform DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) with `execute` and batch operations with `batchExecute`
- Call stored procedures and functions with IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters using `call`
- Native support for Oracle-specific types: VARRAY, nested tables, OBJECT types, and INTERVAL types
- Change Data Capture (CDC) listener powered by Debezium LogMiner for real-time `onRead`, `onCreate`, `onUpdate`, `onDelete`, and `onError` events
- SSL/TLS-secured connections with configurable keystore and truststore
- Connection pooling with configurable pool size, idle connections, and timeouts
- XA datasource support for distributed transactions
- GraalVM native image compatible for ahead-of-time compilation

## Actions

Actions are operations you invoke on an Oracle database from your integration, including querying records, inserting data, calling stored procedures, and more. The Oracle DB connector exposes actions through a single client:


| Client | Actions |
|--------|---------|
| `Client` | SQL queries, DML execution, batch operations, stored procedure calls |

See the **[Action Reference](actions.md)** for the full list of operations, parameters, and sample code for each client.

## Triggers

Triggers allow your integration to react to data changes happening in an Oracle database in real time. The connector uses Debezium-based Change Data Capture (CDC) to stream row-level change events to an `oracledb:CdcListener`, which invokes your service callbacks automatically.

Supported trigger events:

| Event | Callback | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Record read (snapshot) | `onRead` | Fired during the initial snapshot when existing rows are read from the database. |
| Record created | `onCreate` | Fired when a new row is inserted into a monitored table. |
| Record updated | `onUpdate` | Fired when an existing row is modified in a monitored table. |
| Record deleted | `onDelete` | Fired when a row is deleted from a monitored table. |

See the **[Trigger Reference](triggers.md)** for listener configuration, service callbacks, and the row record passed to each callback.
