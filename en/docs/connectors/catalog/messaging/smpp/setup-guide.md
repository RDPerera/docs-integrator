# Setup Guide

This guide walks you through the SMSC configuration required before using the `ballerina/smpp` connector.

## Prerequisites

- An account with an SMSC, carrier, or aggregator that exposes SMPP v3.4 (either a production short code/sender ID, or a test account from a provider with a free SMPP sandbox)
- Network reachability from the machine running your Ballerina application to the SMSC host and port (SMPP binds are TCP connections; an aggregator-hosted SMSC typically needs your IP allow-listed)

## Obtain SMSC connection details

Gather the following from your SMSC provider:

- **Host** — the SMSC's hostname or IP address
- **Port** — the SMSC's SMPP port. `2775` is the common default; your provider may use a different port
- **System ID** — the SMPP `system_id` (username) used to bind
- **Password** — the password used to bind

:::tip
Ask your provider which bind type your account is provisioned for: `TRANSMITTER` (send only), `RECEIVER` (receive only), or `TRANSCEIVER` (both on one session). A `Client` can use any of the three; a `Listener` accepts only `RECEIVER` or `TRANSCEIVER`.
:::

## (Optional) Obtain TLS material

If your SMSC offers SMPP over TLS (recommended — a plaintext bind sends `system_id`/`password` in cleartext), also obtain:

- A PKCS12/JKS truststore, or a PEM CA certificate, that verifies the SMSC's server certificate
- For mutual TLS, a PKCS12/JKS keystore containing your client certificate and key

:::note
A truststore or certificate path is a file path, not its contents. Place the file on the machine running your Ballerina application and reference its path in the connection configuration.
